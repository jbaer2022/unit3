Interactive Form
By: Jacob Baer

Project:
creates an interactive form that the user must fill out. It begins focusing on the name. Then, it gives job options. if it is none of the options, one can choose "other" and fill in their job role. One can then choose a T-shirt size and design. Certain designs only have certain colors. Then one can register for activities. If an activity that overlaps is chosen, then the one that overlaps is crossed off. Then finally it takes the payment method. when one is chosen it hides the other methods. Then when submit certain elements must be filled or else it does not let the user submit.
